# hello-world
## The classic test

No really - this is a classic.

However I should figure out what markdown is...

There's **bold** and *italic*
and automatic links https://github.com/kwstreet/hello-world
or formatted links [hello-world](https://github.com/kwstreet/hello-world)

There's block quotes:
> This is a quote, but not a good one.
> And this is the second line of the quote.

And inline code looks like this:

`main(int argc, char** argv)`

There's also a github flavor of markdown with extensions so code like this will format nicely:

    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return True

```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
    if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
    }
}
```
