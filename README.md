# hello-world
The classic test
================
No really - this is a classic.

However I should figure out what markdown is...

Renamed the branch, but it really created a new one.

Editing this in atom on my laptop to see how it merges in.
Editing again directly on GitHub
And the change appears in the local files after I sync
