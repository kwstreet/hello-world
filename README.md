# hello-world
## The classic test

No really - this is a classic.

However I should figure out what markdown is...

There's **bold** and *italic*
and automatic links https://github.com/kwstreet/hello-world
or formatted links [hello-world](https://github.com/kwstreet/hello-world)

There's block quotes:
> This is a quote, but not a good one.
> And this is the second line of the quote.

And inline code looks like this:

`main(int argc, char** argv)`

There's also a github flavor of markdown so code like this may format once uploaded:
    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return True
